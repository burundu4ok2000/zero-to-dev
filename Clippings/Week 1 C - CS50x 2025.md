How to download source code into VS Code
1. Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/).
2. In your terminal window, type
	```
	wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2024/fall/lectures/1/src1.zip
	```
	followed by Enter in order to download a Zip file of lecture’s source code into your codespace.
3. In your terminal window, type
	```
	unzip src1.zip
	```
	followed by Enter to unzip (i.e., decompress) that Zip file.
4. In your terminal window, type
	```
	cd src1
	```
	followed by Enter in order to “change directory” into that `src1` directory (i.e., folder).
5. In your terminal window, type, e.g.,
	```
	make hello0
	```
	followed by Enter in order to compile, e.g., `hello0.c` (source code) into `hello0` (machine code).
6. In your terminal window, type, e.g.,
	```
	./hello0
	```
	followed by Enter in order to run, e.g., `hello0`.

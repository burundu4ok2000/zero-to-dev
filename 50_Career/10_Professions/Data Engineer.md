## Where they work (countries & typical companies)

- **Germany** — Berlin/Munich; product tech, banks, consultancies. **Relocation path:** EU Blue Card or the new **Opportunity Card** (lets non-EU candidates enter and job-hunt for up to **12 months**). ([Make It In Germany](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/opportunity-card/job-search-opportunity-card?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Job search opportunity card - Make it in Germany"), [Make It In Germany](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/skilled-immigration-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The new Skilled Immigration Act - Make it in Germany"))

- **Serbia** — Belgrade/Novi Sad; global R&D (Microsoft, Bosch, EPAM) and local fintechs. **Relocation path:** visa-light entry for Russians and a unified **single residence+work permit** (valid up to **3 years**). ([Microsoft Careers](https://careers.microsoft.com/professionals/us/en/l-belgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Jobs in Belgrade"), [Welcome to Serbia](https://welcometoserbia.gov.rs/residence-and-work-permit?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Residence and work permit"), [Zunic Law](https://zuniclaw.com/en/serbia-residence-permit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Serbia Residence Permit in 2025 - Zunic Law"))

## Starter-friendly?

**Yes, with discipline.** You can break in via **SQL + Python + dbt** projects and a tight portfolio. Interview focus is pipelines, SQL, and data modeling more than LeetCode.

**Speed to first job:** **Moderate.** Poland/Serbia are faster on local/remote-friendly roles; Germany is great but paperwork takes time (Opportunity Card helps). ([Make It In Germany](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/opportunity-card/job-search-opportunity-card?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Job search opportunity card - Make it in Germany"))

## Growth & ceiling

Senior → **Staff/Platform** (lakehouse, streaming, governance) or pivot to **Analytics Engineering / MLOps / Data Architecture**.

## Trodden relocation paths (from Russia) — pragmatic

- **Germany:** Apply for **Opportunity Card** → land a DE offer → convert to Blue Card. ([Make It In Germany](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/opportunity-card/job-search-opportunity-card?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Job search opportunity card - Make it in Germany"), [Make It In Germany](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/skilled-immigration-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The new Skilled Immigration Act - Make it in Germany"))
    
- **Poland:** Target employers ready to sponsor **EU Blue Card** (hit the salary floor). ([ONE PLUS](https://www.one-plus.pl/en/new-conditions-blue-card-minimum-salary-2025-poland/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "New Conditions: Blue Card Minimum Salary 2025 Poland"))
    
- **Serbia:** Enter easily, secure job, then file the **single residence+work permit** online (valid up to 3 years). ([Welcome to Serbia](https://welcometoserbia.gov.rs/residence-and-work-permit?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Residence and work permit"))
    
- **To the USA (proven routes):**
    
    - **Study → OPT → H-1B:** U.S. STEM degree → **12-month OPT + 24-month STEM OPT** → employer enters you in the **beneficiary-centric** H-1B selection. ([USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students ..."), [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-electronic-registration-process?utm_source=chatgpt.com "H-1B Electronic Registration Process"))
        
    - **Intra-company transfer (L-1):** Work **≥1 continuous year** for a multinational abroad, then transfer to the U.S. entity. ([USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager?utm_source=chatgpt.com "L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager"))

## Who thrives / who struggles

- **Thrives:** systems thinkers, SQL lovers, people who enjoy reliability, testing, and clean contracts.
    
- **Struggles:** those who dislike documentation, backfills, and long-running glue work.

## My fit (0–10) — for Stanislav

**8/10.** You like the **builder** vibe, EU relocation is realistic (Serbia/Poland quick start; Germany great upside), and there’s a credible long-term bridge to the **U.S.** via L-1 or study→OPT→H-1B.

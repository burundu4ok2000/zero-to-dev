> **One-liner:** **CompTIA Network+** is a vendor-neutral certification that proves foundational skills in **networking concepts, infrastructure, operations, security, and troubleshooting**. 

---

## The Big Idea

Network+ validates that you can **design, manage, and troubleshoot** wired and wireless networks — from IP addressing to cabling, from routers to firewalls.

It builds on A+ and is ideal for roles like **network technician, support specialist, or junior admin**.

## What It Covers (at a glance)

- **Networking Concepts:** OSI model, TCP/IP, ports, protocols, IP addressing/subnets
    
- **Infrastructure:** switches, routers, firewalls, access points, cloud/network topologies
    
- **Network Operations:** diagrams, documentation, monitoring tools, policies
    
- **Network Security:** firewalls, VPN, AAA, common threats and mitigation
    
- **Troubleshooting:** step-by-step process, command-line tools, diagnostics

## Who It’s For

- Junior **Network Engineers / Technicians**
    
- **IT Support** roles who want to go deeper
    
- People preparing for **Security+**, Cisco CCNA, or cloud networking

## Exam Snapshot (high level)

- 90 questions, ~90 minutes
    
- Mix of **multiple choice** + **performance-based** scenarios

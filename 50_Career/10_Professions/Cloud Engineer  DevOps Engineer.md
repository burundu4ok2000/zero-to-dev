  

> **One-liner:** Build and run the cloud/platform glue—**infrastructure, CI/CD, reliability, cost**—so product teams ship fast without breaking prod.

---

**What they do (day-to-day)**

- IaC (**Terraform/CloudFormation**), container & cluster ops (**Docker/K8s**), CI/CD pipelines, observability (logs/metrics/traces), secrets & access, cost/perf tuning, incident response & SRE practices.
    

  

**Where they work (and why)**

- **Germany (Berlin/Munich):** product tech, auto, fintech, consultancies. Strong relocation via **Opportunity Card → EU Blue Card**. Opportunity Card grants **up to 12 months** in-country to job-hunt; Blue Card junior/shortage/IT threshold **€43,759.80** (general **€48,300**) in 2025.   
    
- **Poland (Warsaw/Kraków):** product + nearshore hubs; English-friendly. **EU Blue Card** 2025 minimum **PLN 12,272.58** gross/month. 
    
- **Serbia (Belgrade/Novi Sad):** multinational R&D + local fintech; **single residence+work permit** (biometric) valid **up to 3 years**, extendable. 
    
    _(UK caution: Skilled Worker general threshold now_ **_£41,700_** _or the job’s “going rate,” whichever is higher.)_ 
    

  

**Salary (junior / mid) — 2025-08, indicative bands**

- **Germany (gross/year):** **€56–65k / €68–85k** (Cloud/DevOps averages around **€68k** with 25–75th pct ~€56–82k). 
    
- **Poland (gross/month, UoP/B2B):** **PLN 9–12k / 16–21k (UoP mid ~9–14k; B2B mid ~16–21k; senior B2B medians near 28–30k)**. 
    
- **Serbia (net/month, Belgrade):** **€1.1–1.5k / €1.8–2.4k** (HelloWorld medians: junior ≈**€1.27k**, mid ≈**€2.04k**, senior ≈**€2.84k**). 
    

  

**Starter-friendly?**

**Moderate.** You can break in with **Linux + networking basics + IaC + CI/CD** and a small homelab. Faster entry via **Poland/Serbia** (paperwork), **Germany** is excellent but visa steps add time. 

  

**Speed to first job**

**Moderate → Fast** if you ship a portfolio:

- Deploy a **3-tier app** with Terraform + K8s;
    
- Add CI/CD, logging, alerting, **runbook**;
    
- Show **cost before/after** (rightsizing) and **RTO/RPO** decisions.
    

  

**Growth & ceiling**

- Up: **Senior/Staff**, **SRE**, **Platform/Cloud Architect**, **Security/DevSecOps**, **FinOps**.
    
- Side moves: **Backend**, **Data/ML Platform**, **Site Reliability**.
    

  

**Who thrives / who struggles**

- **Thrives:** systems thinkers, “automate the boring,” patient with incidents, like measurable impact (latency, SLOs, cost).
    
- **Struggles:** dislike docs/runbooks, hate on-call, prefer pure feature coding.
    

  

**My fit (0–10) — for Stanislav**

**8/10.** Your DE/ETL focus pairs well with **cloud + pipelines**. Start in **PL/RS** (faster), target **DE** after 6–12 months of ops wins; keep US as a long-game via study→OPT/H-1B or L-1 transfer later.

  

> **One-liner:** Monitor, detect, and respond to threats; keep systems safe with **SIEM/SOC**, EDR, and clear incident playbooks.

---

**What they do (day-to-day)**

- Triage alerts in a **SIEM** (Splunk/QRadar/Defender), investigate endpoints, escalate incidents, patch risks, write detection rules, and report impact to the business.
    

  

**Where they work (countries & companies)**

- **Germany** — product tech, auto, finance, consultancies; relocation via the **Opportunity Card** (12-month job-hunt) → **EU Blue Card** once hired. 
    
- **Poland** — Warsaw/Kraków hubs; product + outsourcing centers; Blue Card sponsorship common **if salary meets the 2025 floor**. 
    
- **Serbia** — Belgrade/Novi Sad; multinational R&D + fintech; streamlined **single residence+work permit** (valid **up to 3 years**). 
    
    _(UK hiring is possible but junior sponsorship is tough due to higher Skilled Worker salary thresholds.)_ 
    

  

**Salary (junior / mid) — 2025-08 (indicative bands)**

- **Germany (gross/year):** **€49–55k / €60–75k**, with city/industry variance (StepStone/Glassdoor snapshots). 
    
- **Poland (gross/month):** **PLN 8–12k / 12–17k**; recent employer-posted medians for “Cybersecurity Specialist” land in the **PLN 16–23k** band for stronger mid profiles. 
    
- **Serbia (net/month):** **~110–160k RSD / 160–220k RSD** typical IT-security ranges; national data aggregation places infosec averages near **~163k RSD**/mo. 
    

  

**Starter-friendly?**

**Yes (SOC track).** Fastest entry is **SOC Tier-1** with solid **SQL + networking basics** and a small homelab (SIEM + Windows/Linux). **Speed:** **Moderate**—Poland/Serbia faster on paperwork; Germany great but needs the Opportunity Card/offer first. 

  

**Growth & adjacent roles**

- Up: **Senior Analyst → Detection Engineer → Incident Responder → Blue-Team Lead**.
    
- Side: **Security Engineer, GRC Analyst, Cloud Sec, Threat Intel**.
    

  

**Who thrives / who struggles**

- **Thrives:** detail-oriented, calm under pressure, enjoys logs/runbooks and steady improvements.
    
- **Struggles:** hates documentation, low patience for on-call and repetitive tuning.
    

  

**Relocation notes (from Russia)**

- **Germany:** Apply for the **Opportunity Card** (points-based, up to 12 months) → convert to **Blue Card** with an offer. 
    
- **Poland:** Target offers meeting the **EU Blue Card minimum PLN 12,272.58 gross/month (2025)**. 
    
- **Serbia:** Use the **single permit** route; validity **up to 3 years**, extensions available. 
    
- **USA (well-trodden):** **Study → OPT (12m) + STEM OPT (24m)**, then H-1B (now **beneficiary-centric** selection of **unique beneficiaries**). 
    

  

**My fit (0–10) — for Stanislav**

**7.5/10.** Good near-term entry via **SOC** in **Poland/Serbia**, with growth into detection/engineering; Germany is strong medium-term once paperwork is lined up.

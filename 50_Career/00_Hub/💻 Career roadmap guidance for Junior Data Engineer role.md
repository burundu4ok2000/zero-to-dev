### Portfolio Project Ideas

| Project (summary) | Skills demonstrated | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1¬†‚Äì API‚Äëto‚Äëwarehouse ETL** | *Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Docker, Airflow.* | Build a pipeline that fetches public API data (e.g., weather or cryptocurrency), cleans it with pandas and loads it into a Postgres or BigQuery warehouse. Containerize the ETL with Docker to ensure environment consistency[dataengineeracademy.com](https://dataengineeracademy.com/blog/docker-fundamentals-for-data-engineers/#:~:text=Docker%20is%20a%20platform%20designed,deployed%20consistently%20across%20various%20platforms). Schedule the job with Airflow ‚Äì Airflow lets you author and monitor DAGs[qubole.com](https://www.qubole.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-apache-airflow#:~:text=What%20is%20Apache%20Airflow%3F). Publish the code and a blog explaining your architecture. |
| **2¬†‚Äì Streaming analytics with Kafka & Spark** | *Kafka, Spark¬†Structured¬†Streaming, Docker Compose, Data visualization.* | Set up Kafka and Spark in Docker Compose; ingest streaming data (e.g., stock trades or IoT sensor feed). Process the stream in real‚Äëtime with Spark and persist aggregated metrics into a database. Create a simple dashboard using Plotly or Grafana. This shows competency in real‚Äëtime processing frameworks[prophecy.io](https://www.prophecy.io/blog/12-essential-data-engineering-skills#:~:text=,MLOps) and distributed systems. |
| **3¬†‚Äì E‚Äëcommerce data warehouse & dashboard** | *Schema design, ETL/ELT, dbt, BI tools.* | Use a public e‚Äëcommerce dataset to design a star schema. Build an ELT pipeline (e.g., using dbt) to populate fact and dimension tables. Implement data validation checks. Connect to Tableau Public or Power¬†BI to create sales and customer dashboards. This demonstrates data modeling, warehousing, and visualization; data engineer job postings call out these skills[365datascience.com](https://365datascience.com/career-advice/data-engineer-job-outlook-2025/#:~:text=,SQL%20and%20Python). |

### Publishing Platforms & Networking

- **GitHub:** Keep all project code here. Use pinned repositories, regular commits and a profile README to demonstrate consistency and open‚Äësource contributions[dataengineeracademy.com](https://dataengineeracademy.com/module/how-to-use-github-to-showcase-your-data-engineering-skills/#:~:text=,you%E2%80%99d%20like%20visitors%20to%20see).
- **Medium / Dev.to:** Write posts explaining your projects, design decisions and lessons learned. This builds credibility and helps others learn.
- **LinkedIn:** Share updates and network with professionals; add projects under the ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù section[coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-engineer-do-and-how-do-i-become-one#:~:text=3,data%20engineering%20projects).
- **CS50 / Data‚Äëengineering communities:** Engage with Discord/Slack channels, Reddit (r/dataengineering) and open‚Äësource projects to meet peers and potential mentors.
- **Personal blog or GitHub Pages:** Optionally, create a simple site summarizing your journey and linking to your GitHub repos.

### Final Tips

- **Dedicate ~40¬†hours/week** consistently; treat this like a part‚Äëtime job.
- **Build in public:** regularly post updates; this helps with accountability and networking.
- **Balance learning with doing:** focus each month on a tangible project; employers value demonstrable skills.
- **Stay current:** the field evolves quickly ‚Äì keep an eye on emerging tools like Prefect, dbt, Polars or DuckDB.
- **Humour & sanity:** remember to take breaks. Even data engineers need to `sleep(8)` to avoid `MemoryError`!

By following this structured, project‚Äëdriven roadmap, leveraging CS50x for foundational skills and continuously showcasing your progress, you‚Äôll position yourself as a strong candidate for junior data‚Äëengineering roles in 2026.

  

> **One-liner:** **DataCamp = hands-on reps (SQL/pandas) fast. 365 Data Science = clear conceptual backbone (stats/ML/business).** Use both, but ship artifacts weekly.

---

## **When to use which**

- **DataCamp (daily):** 30–45 min drills for **SQL joins, windows, pandas cleaning, shell/Git**. Quick feedback → muscle memory.
    
- **365 (weekly):** 1–2 modules for **statistics intuition, metrics logic, storytelling**. Strong “why” behind your pipeline.

## **How to turn courses into portfolio**

- After each DataCamp session: **rebuild locally** (DuckDB/Postgres + Python), then commit a tiny folder:
    
    YYYY-MM-DD/README.md + code + sample_output.
    
- After each 365 block: write a **300–500 word note** “What I’ll change in my ETL.”
    

  

**Rule:** Certificates are nice; **repos + READMEs get interviews**.

## **Minimal 6-week ramp (concise)**

- **W1–W2:** DataCamp SQL → windows; pandas cleaning.
    
    **Project #1:** CSV → DuckDB, 3 queries, README.
    
- **W3:** 365 stats (distributions/outliers).
    
    **Project #2:** API → pandas → Postgres, add Docker.
    
- **W4:** Schedule (cron or simple orchestrator).
    
    Note: _Idempotency & backfills — my rules._
    
- **W5:** 365 data storytelling.
    
    Add one clean chart answering “so what?”
    
- **W6:** Logs, .env, error handling.
    
    Record a 2-min walkthrough or tighten README.

## **Country reality (short)**

- **US/EU/UK/NL/DE:** Both brands recognized; English content ok. Recruiters care more about **Github artifacts** than platform badges.
    

---

## **Red flags to avoid**

- Endless watching with zero repos.
    
- Giant capstone you’ll never finish.
    
- “SELECT *” portfolios (no business question answered).

## **Bottom line**

  

**DataCamp moves your hands. 365 sharpens your head.** Ship one tiny, boring, **done** project every week. Consistency wins.

## One-liner

  

Harvard and MIT are neighbors in **Cambridge, MA** (across the Charles from Boston), which is why CS50 casually says they’re “down the street.”

  

## What you should take away

  

- Cambridge, **Massachusetts** is a city across the **Charles River** from Boston; it is home to **Harvard University** (Harvard Square) and **MIT** (Kendall Square).  

- There is also **Cambridge, England** (home to the University of Cambridge) — same name, different place.  

- CS50 references both schools because Harvard hosts the class and MIT is literally a short walk away.

  

## Key facts & geography

  

- Distance between Harvard Yard and MIT’s Great Dome: ~1 mile (~1.6 km).  

- Common transit: **Red Line** between Harvard, Central, Kendall/MIT.  

- The neighborhoods (“squares”) help you navigate: **Harvard Sq.**, **Central Sq.**, **Kendall/MIT**.

  

## Name clash: Cambridge (MA) vs Cambridge (UK)

  

| City | Country | Famous university | Vibe |

|---|---|---|---|

| Cambridge | USA (Massachusetts) | **Harvard**, **MIT** | Dense urban campus clusters |

| Cambridge | UK (England) | **University of Cambridge** | Historic collegiate town |

  

## Why this shows up in Week 0

  

- Orientation: CS50 mentions local landmarks and the proximity of Harvard ↔ MIT.  

- Scratch week is light on code; it’s a good time to get **context** about where the course lives.

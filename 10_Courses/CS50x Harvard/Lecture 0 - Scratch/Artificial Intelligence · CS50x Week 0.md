## **One-liner**

  

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is about writing **programs** that show behaviors we’d call **intelligent** in humans—making **decisions**, finding **patterns**, and improving with **data**.

  

## What CS50 signals in Week 0

  

- We’re **not starting** with AI code on day one. Instead, we build **foundations** (\\*Scratch blocks\\*, **algorithms**, **abstraction**, **pseudocode**).  

- Later in the course we’ll revisit AI with real **code**, but Week 0 frames the **goal** and **trajectory**.

  

## Mental model (for Week 0 level)

  

Think of AI as a **pipeline**:

  

1. **Inputs** (numbers, text, images).  

2. **Rules or model** (hand‑written **algorithms** or learned **parameters**).  

3. **Outputs** (predictions, actions, decisions).

  

In Scratch, you already build tiny “AIs” by composing **conditionals** and **loops** that react to **events** and **sensed** values (e.g., sprite distance, key presses).

  

## Scratch‑level examples

  

- **Rule‑based behavior**: If enemy is **near**, **run away**; else **patrol**.  

- **Greedy strategy**: Move toward the **largest coin** you can see.  

- **State machine**: Idle → Chase → Flee depending on **health** and **distance**.

  

These are all **algorithms** that map **inputs** to **actions**—the on‑ramp to AI thinking.

  

## What to practice now (to be AI‑ready later)

  

- Express ideas as **pseudocode** → blocks → behavior.  

- Use **variables**, **conditionals**, **loops**, and **events** to encode **decision logic**.  

- Decompose problems with **abstraction** (helpers/blocks) and name things well.  

- Measure **correctness** (does it do what you intended?) and iterate on **design**/**style**.

  

## Vocabulary for later weeks

  

- **Algorithm** — a precise **procedure** that turns inputs into outputs.  

- **Heuristic** — a **rule of thumb** that’s fast and usually good enough.  

- **Model** — a parameterized **function** learned from **data**.  

- **Training** — process that tunes **parameters** to fit examples.  

- **Inference** — using a trained **model** to make predictions.

  

## Related Concepts

  

- [[Algorithm vs Heuristic]] – planning exact steps vs quick rules.  

- [[Abstraction in Scratch]] – defining **custom blocks** to reuse logic.  

- [[Pseudocode to Blocks]] – translating intent into Scratch.  

- [[Control Flow in Scratch]] – **if/else**, **loops**, and **events**.  

- [[Variables and State (Scratch)]] – storing and updating information.  

- [[Problem Decomposition]] – breaking tasks into smaller steps.

## Why it shows up in Week 0

  

- CS50 is filmed in **Cambridge, Massachusetts**; the city shares its name with **Cambridge, England**.  

- Cambridge (UK) is a world‑class **research university** whose alumni shaped **computer science**; it’s a nice anchor when the course mentions “Cambridge.”  

- Knowing the geography and the two Cambridges helps map the course’s cultural references.

## Quick orientation

  

- Location: **Cambridge, England**, just north of London; a compact **college** town on the River Cam.  

- Structure: a federation of **colleges** (e.g., King’s, Trinity) + university **faculties** and labs.  

- Vibe: bikes, quads, libraries, and very old buildings with very modern **research** inside.

- Binary is the foundation of all computing: everything breaks down into 0s and 1s.
    
- Each **transistor** in a computer represents either an ON (1) or OFF (0) state.
    
- A sequence of transistors can represent powers of 2:

    - 2⁰ = 1
        
    - 2¹ = 2
        
    - 2² = 4
        
    - 2³ = 8
        
    - and so on.
        
- Together, these bits form **binary numbers** which are used to store and process all data.
    
- Example: binary `101` = 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 5
    

🧠 The key idea: computers interpret millions (or billions) of these on/off switches to represent numbers, letters, images, videos, and more.

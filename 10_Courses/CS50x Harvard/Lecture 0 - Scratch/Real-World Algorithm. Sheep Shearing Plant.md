#### **📄 Example: Automated Sheep Shearing Plant**

  

In this example, David Malan introduces an algorithm used in an industrial setting to shear sheep automatically.

  

> “The proposed plant represents a simple concept which has these requirements…”

🧠 **Key Idea:**

Even something as physical as shearing sheep can be broken down into a **step-by-step sequence**, i.e. **an algorithm**.

  

#### **✅ Features of the plant (from slide):**

- Modular system, fast setup and dismantle
    
- Highly productive, automated plant
    
- Self-monitoring for safety and reliability
    
- Cost-effective compared to manual shearing teams

#### **💬 Quote from the Lecture**

  

> _“Going to trim my beard, which has gotten out of whack.”_

  

🎭 **Meaning:**

He makes a humorous comparison between the precise automated grooming of sheep and his own beard, which he says is “out of whack” (i.e. messy, not in order).

#### **💡 Insight**

  

This moment reinforces the idea that **algorithms aren’t just for code**—they can describe real-world processes, too.

It also shows how even everyday activities (like grooming) follow repeatable, optimizable steps.

## **One-liner**

A **real‑world algorithm** is just a **step‑by‑step** plan that turns inputs (sensors, constraints) into outputs (actions) with **safety** and **feedback** baked in.

## Big picture

- Even physical systems—like an **automated sheep‑shearing plant**—follow a precise **algorithm**: detect, decide, act, repeat.  
- Good algorithms are **modular** (separate stations), **efficient** (throughput), **reliable** (self‑monitoring), and **cost‑effective** (beats manual teams).  
- This mirrors software engineering: define **inputs**, choose a **procedure**, produce **outputs**, and handle **edge cases**.

## Core idea (map to CS concepts)

| Plant feature | Software analogue | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Self‑monitoring for safety | **Assertions**, **invariants**, **error handling** | Detects faults early, prevents damage |
| Modular stations | **Abstraction**, **functions**, **APIs** | Swap/upgrade pieces independently |
| High throughput | **Time complexity**, **parallelism** | More work per unit time |
| Setup/teardown | **Deployment scripts**, **automation** | Fast iteration, reproducibility |

## Minimal pseudo‑code

```text
loop forever:
    sense_position()            # sensors
    if not safe():              # guard preconditions
        halt_and_alert()
        continue
    align_animal()
    start_shears()
    cut_section()
    stop_shears()
    log_telemetry()
```

## Design checklist

- Define **preconditions** (safe positions, clear paths).  
- Separate **sensing**, **decision**, and **actuation** into functions.  
- Add **telemetry** (logging) and **fallbacks** (emergency stop).  
- Optimize **bottlenecks** only after you have correctness.

ðŸ’¡ **Concept**:

Computers represent binary data using **electrical voltages**.

- A **0** is represented by something close to **0 volts**
    
- A **1** is represented by around **5 volts** (or a high voltage)
    

  

ðŸ“Œ **Why it matters**:

This is the physical layer of computation â€” how actual 1s and 0s are stored in memory and transmitted. Transistors act like little switches, turning on (1) or off (0) depending on the voltage.

ðŸ“Œ **ðŸ¤” Why 5 volts specifically?**

Historically:

- **Early computers** and logic gates ran on **TTL (Transistorâ€“Transistor Logic)**, which used **5V** as the high signal.
    
- It became a **standard**, easy to detect and reliable.
    
- In modern systems (like smartphones), voltage levels can be even lower (like **3.3V**, **1.8V**, or even less) â€” to save power and reduce heat.

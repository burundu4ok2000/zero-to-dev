## What is ASCII?

ASCII stands for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**.  
It is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers.

Each character (letters, numbers, symbols) is represented by a number between 0 and 127.

## Binary Representation of ASCII

Computers store everything as bits (0s and 1s). Each ASCII character is stored using **8 bits** (a byte), though only the first 7 bits are used in standard ASCII.

For example:

- The capital letter **A** is represented by the decimal number **65**, which is **01000001** in binary.
    
- The lowercase **a** is **97**, which is **01100001** in binary.
    

## ASCII in CS50x Lecture

In Lecture 0, David Malan introduces ASCII by showing how characters like **"A"** are encoded in binary.

He also mentions that understanding ASCII isn't always necessary in practice, but it's important CS trivia that helps you understand how computers work internally.

## Key Concept

> Every letter you type is just a number under the hood.

- Characters → Numbers
    
- Numbers → Binary
    
- Binary → Stored in memory via transistors

## **One-liner**

**Video** = a **sequence of images (frames)** + **audio** + **timing metadata**, compressed by a **codec** and packaged by a **container**.

## Big picture

- **Frames** are pictures. Some are full (**intra-frames**), most store only **differences** from nearby frames (**inter-frames**).  
- A **codec** (coder/decoder) defines the **rules** to compress/decompress streams (e.g., **H.264**, **AV1**).  
- A **container** (e.g., **MP4**, **MKV**) **bundles** the video stream, audio tracks, captions, and **timestamps** into one file.

## 1080p60 reality check

- **Resolution:** 1920 Ã— 1080 â‰ˆ 2 million pixels/frame.  
- **Frame rate:** 60 fps â†’ 60 frames/second.  
- **Raw size would be huge**; with **H.264**, typical online **bitrate** is **3â€“6 Mbit/s** for watchable quality.  
- Without a codec, raw 1080p60 would be **hundreds of Mbit/s** â€” impractical for storage/streaming.

### What a codec does (mental model)

1) **Encode** (compress) when saving/streaming.  
2) **Decode** (decompress) when playing back.

## Glossary-on-one-screen

| Term | TL;DR |
|-----|------|
| **Frame** | One picture in the sequence |
| **FPS** | Frames per second (timing cadence) |
| **Bitrate** | How many bits per second after compression |
| **Codec** | Rules/algorithm to compress/decompress (H.264/AV1/HEVC) |
| **Container** | File wrapper for streams + metadata (MP4/MKV) |
| **Keyframe (Iâ€‘frame)** | A full, standalone frame |
| **P/Bâ€‘frames** | Frames that store *differences* from other frames |

## Practical notes

- Higher **bitrate** â‰ˆ better quality but larger files; **VBR** (variable bitrate) adapts to scene complexity.  
- **Resolution** and **FPS** multiply data needs; 4K60 needs far more bitrate than 1080p30 for similar quality.  
- When editing/exporting, pick a **codec/container** your target platform supports (H.264 in MP4 is the common baseline).

 *Quick guide to the two famous universities that share the same city – and the Cambridge name clash.*

## 🗺️ Cambridge, Massachusetts  
- Independent **city** on the north side of the Charles River, across from Boston.  
- Population ≈ 118 000; part of the “Greater Boston” metro area.  
- Home to **two world-class universities only ~1 mile apart**:  
  - [[Harvard University (USA)]]  (1636) – Harvard Square.  
  - [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]  (1861) – Kendall Square / MIT Campus.  

> **“Down the street”** in CS50 refers to this literal walking distance.

### 🚦 Why the name confusion?  
There is also **Cambridge (UK)**, home of [[University of Cambridge (UK)]].  
The US city was named after the English one in 1638, so *Cambridge* can mean two very different academic hubs.

| City / Country | Famous University | Key Focus |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Cambridge, **MA (USA)** | Harvard, MIT | Liberal arts + STEM powerhouses |
| Cambridge, **England** | University of Cambridge | Historic research university |

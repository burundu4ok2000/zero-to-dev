## **One-liner**

**ASCII** started as a **7‑bit encoding** with only **128 characters**—great for early English‑only computing, terrible for a multilingual Internet; the modern fix is **Unicode/UTF‑8**.

## Big idea

- **7‑bit ASCII (2^7 = 128)** covered English letters, digits, punctuation, and **control characters**, but excluded most of the world’s writing systems.  
- Vendors bolted on **8‑bit “extended ASCII”** pages (256 codes) that conflicted with each other (**code page** chaos).  
- **Unicode** unified characters into global **code points**; **UTF‑8** encodes them in 1–4 bytes and remains **backward‑compatible with ASCII** (0–127).

## Why the 7‑bit limit was “unfortunate”

- Forced fragmented **encodings** (Windows‑1252, ISO‑8859‑1, KOI8‑R, …).  
- Files broke when moved between systems with different **code pages**.  
- Couldn’t represent names, accents, or non‑Latin scripts—bad UX and data loss.

## Minimal examples

```text
ASCII (7-bit)        : 'A' = 65, 'a' = 97
Extended ASCII (8-bit): 0x80–0xFF vary by code page
UTF-8                 : U+1F600 😀 encodes to F0 9F 98 80
```

```c
// ASCII-safe bytes
unsigned char a = 'A';   // 0x41
// UTF-8 is a byte sequence; strings can contain multi-byte chars
const char *smile = "😀"; // 4 bytes in UTF-8
```

## Practical guidance

- Default to **UTF‑8** everywhere (source files, terminals, databases).  
- Treat **bytes** and **characters** as different concepts; a single **character** may be multiple bytes.  
- When counting “characters,” use libraries that understand **code points** (not just byte length).  
- Normalize input if you compare strings with accents/combining marks.

## Gotchas you’ll meet

- **Mojibake**: text looks garbled because the wrong **encoding** was assumed.  
- “Length” mismatches: `len(bytes) != number of characters` with UTF‑8.  
- Sorting/case‑folding rules vary by locale; stick to **Unicode‑aware** functions.

- [[Code Pages and Encodings]] – why extended ASCII fragmented.  
- [[Control Characters (ASCII)]] – non‑printing bytes 0–31 and 127.  
- [[UTF-16 and UTF-32]] – alternative Unicode encodings.  
- [[Text Normalization (NFC/NFD)]] – comparing canonically equivalent strings.

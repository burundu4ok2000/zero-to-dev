## **One-liner**

  

CS50’s giant yellow **duck** is a live mascot for **rubber‑duck debugging**: explain your code out loud and the bug often reveals itself.

  

## Big picture

  

- Shows up in **Lecture 0** on stage at [[Sanders Theatre]] as a playful reminder to practice **debugging** deliberately.  

- Connects beginner energy (a silly prop) with a serious habit: forcing **clarity of thought** by verbalizing each step of an **algorithm**.  

- Works solo (to yourself/the duck) or with peers; the key is to articulate **assumptions** and walk the **logic** line‑by‑line.

  

## How to use the duck (for real)

  

1. State the **goal** (“what should this function return?”).  

2. Read the code to the duck, **line by line**, in plain English.  

3. At each line, say what you expect to happen and what actually happens (print **intermediate values** if needed).  

4. When expectation and reality diverge, you’ve found the **bug’s neighborhood**. Fix, then re‑explain.

  

## Why it works

  

- Speaking forces **precise mental models** and reveals hidden leaps of logic.  

- The duck is nonjudgmental; you won’t skip steps to save face.  

- Pairs nicely with **unit tests** and **printf debugging** for fast feedback.

  

## CS50 connections

  

- Becomes a recurring in‑joke and memory cue: when stuck, **talk to the duck**.  

- Embeds a culture of **explanatory thinking** early in Week 0 before deeper C/Scratch details.

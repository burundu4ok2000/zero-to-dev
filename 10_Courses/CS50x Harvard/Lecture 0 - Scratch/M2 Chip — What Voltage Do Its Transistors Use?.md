  

In modern processors like **Apple’s M2**, each transistor is **incredibly small** — measured in **nanometers**. The smaller the transistor, the **lower the voltage** it needs.

  

#### **⚡ Typical Voltages:**

- **M2 transistors** likely operate at **around 0.6–1.1 volts**, depending on the performance mode (low-power vs turbo).
    
- That’s way below the old-school **5V** used in early computers.

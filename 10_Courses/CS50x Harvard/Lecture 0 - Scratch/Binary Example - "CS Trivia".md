## 🧠 Binary Example Explained

During the lecture, Professor David Malan shows the binary number `01000000` and calls it "CS trivia." Here's what it means:

### 🧮 Binary Breakdown:

Each binary digit (bit) represents a power of 2, starting from the right:

|Bit Position|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Power of 2|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|Binary|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|

**Only the 2⁶ bit is set to 1**, which equals:

```
2^6 = 64
```

So, `01000000` in binary is **64 in decimal**.

## 🤔 What is "CS Trivia"?

"CS trivia" refers to facts or details that aren't essential for every programmer but are fun or useful to know. They often:

- Show up in interviews
    
- Help you understand how things work under the hood
    
- Make you a more informed developer
    

In this case, knowing how `01000000` translates to `64`, and how it may map to a character in **ASCII**, is a trivia point—but it reflects foundational knowledge.

Let me know if you'd like to add the ASCII explanation or connect this to actual characters (like `@`), which is ASCII 64.

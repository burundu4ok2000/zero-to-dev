## One-liner

**MIT** (f. 1861) is the Cambridge neighbor whose labs — **Media Lab**, **CSAIL** — helped shape modern **CS**, including **Scratch** used in CS50 Week 0.

## Key facts (from the slide/handout)

- **Founded:** 1861 — mission-driven toward advancing science & technology.  
- **Location:** 77 Massachusetts Ave, **Cambridge (MA)** — “down the street” from Harvard.  
- **Reputation:** Top global rankings in **CS**, **Engineering**, **AI**, **Physics**.  
- **Media Lab**, **CSAIL**, and **Scratch** (visual coding language) were created here.  
- **Mascot:** Tim the **Beaver** 🦫.

## Why it matters in Week 0

- **Scratch** — the block-based environment you start with — was built at MIT’s **Media Lab**.  
- The idea of **abstraction** and **problem decomposition** you learn in Scratch echoes research traditions at **CSAIL**.  
- CS50’s tour of **Cambridge** (Harvard ↔ MIT) is a reminder that **collaboration** across institutions drives computing forward.

## Quick map in your head

- Harvard Yard ←→ **MIT Infinite Corridor** (a few T stops apart).  
- Both sit in **Cambridge, MA**; you’ll see both names sprinkled across CS50 stories and examples.

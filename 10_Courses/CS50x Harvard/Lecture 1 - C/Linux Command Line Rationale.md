## **One-liner**

Why Linux and the **command line**? Because typing **commands** is faster, more **automatable**, and closer to how software actually runs on real servers.

## Big picture

- CS50 drops you into a cloud **Ubuntu** shell so you can **build**, **run**, and **debug** like pros do.  
- Modern Linux has GUIs, but the **terminal** remains the power tool for **repeatability** and **scale**.  
- Most servers and containers are **Linux**, so learning CLI now reduces “works on my machine” surprises later.

## Why programmers lean on the CLI

| Benefit | What it buys you | Tiny example |
|---|---|---|
| **Automation** | Chain steps into one line | `make && ./app && ./test.sh` |
| **Scriptability** | Save workflows in scripts | `deploy.sh`, `backup.sh` |
| **Remote access** | Same interface via **SSH** | `ssh user@host` |
| **Reproducibility** | Exact steps are text | Copy/paste command log |
| **Packages** | Quick tool installs | `sudo apt install valgrind` |
| **Transparency** | Inspect processes/files | `ps aux`, `ls -l` |
| **Customization** | **Aliases** and dotfiles | `alias gs='git status'` |

## Orientation: day‑1 commands

| Goal | Command | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Where am I? | `pwd` | Print working directory |
| What’s here? | `ls -lah` | Show hidden + sizes |
| Move around | `cd dir`, `cd ..` | Enter / go up |
| Build | `make hello` | Uses course defaults |
| Run | `./hello` | Execute a binary |
| Peek files | `cat file`, `less file` | Quick read / scroll |

## When the GUI still wins

- Visual tasks (images, diffing screenshots).  
- Drag‑and‑drop assets into a project.  
- Early exploration in the editor’s file tree.  

Use both: **GUI to discover**, **CLI to automate**.

## Take‑away

The terminal isn’t retro; it’s a **force multiplier**. Mastering a few commands unlocks faster builds, cleaner deployments, and easier debugging.

## Related Concepts

- [[Command-Line Interface (CLI)]] – the text‑based interface itself.  
- [[Graphical User Interface (GUI)]] – complements the terminal.  
- [[Keyboard-first Programming]] – build habits around shortcuts and shell.  
- [[VS Code Integrated Terminal]] – one window for editing and commands.  
- [[make Build Tool]] – compile with one command.  
- [[SSH Basics]] – connect securely to remote Linux hosts.  
- [[Package Managers (apt)]] – install toolchains and libraries.

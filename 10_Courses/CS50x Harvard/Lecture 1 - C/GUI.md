## 🧠 GUI Explained

During the lecture, Professor David Malan introduces the term **GUI**, short for **Graphical User Interface**. It's one of two main ways we interact with software (the other being the command line).

A **GUI** lets users interact with programs visually — using windows, buttons, menus, and icons — instead of typing commands.

## 🖥️ GUI vs CLI

| Feature | GUI (Graphical UI) | CLI (Command Line Interface) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ease of Use | Very beginner-friendly | Steeper learning curve |
| Interaction | Clicks, drag-and-drop | Typed commands |
| Speed | Slower for repetitive tasks | Faster for experienced users |
| Used in | Browsers, file managers, apps | Terminals, servers, automation |

Professor Malan explains that **using your keyboard more** (via CLI) is **more efficient** for many tasks like compiling programs, running tests, and working with version control.

## 🧩 Why It Matters in CS50

- VS Code, used in CS50, includes both GUI and CLI tools.
- Understanding GUI helps beginners start.
- CLI skills are essential for serious programming.

## Summary
Breaking code into **functions** turns a long **main** into small, named, reusable **units** with clear **interfaces** (**parameters**, **return value**). This boosts readability, testing, and refactoring speed.

## Key Points
- Extract repeated logic into a **function** → **write once, call many times**.
- A **prototype** lets the compiler type-check calls before seeing the body.
- Keep bodies short (≈ 40–50 lines) and **single responsibility**.
- Clear **names** + **interfaces** (inputs/outputs) are more valuable than clever implementations.
- Call overhead is tiny; premature **inlining** is usually worse for clarity.

## Details
- **Minimal anatomy**: a **prototype**, a **definition** (the body), and a **call site**.
- **Compiler workflow**: the prototype enables checks; the definition compiles to machine code; the call sets up a **stack frame**, passes **arguments** via the **stack**/**registers**, jumps, returns a **value**, then resumes.
- **State isolation**: each call gets its own **locals**; shared state should be explicit via **parameters** or returned values, not hidden **globals**.
- **Testability**: small focused functions are easy to **unit-test** and to **mock** in bigger programs.
- **Maintenance**: renaming a function or swapping its implementation doesn’t break callers if the **interface** stays the same.

## Examples
```c
// prototype
int add(int a, int b);

// definition
int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

// call site
int sum = add(2, 3);
```

### Pain → Fix
| **Pain if everything stays in main** | **How a function fixes it** |
|---|---|
| File grows to hundreds of lines → hard to read | Split logic into **named blocks** you can mentally fold away |
| Repeating the same code in multiple spots | Write once, **call** many times |
| Can’t test specific pieces | **Unit-test** a function in isolation |
| Hard to reason about state | Each call gets its own **parameters / locals** |

## **Why It Matters**
Functions are the vocabulary of programs. Good **API**-like function design lets you refactor internals freely, swap implementations for performance or safety, and keep complexity from leaking across the codebase.

## Questions
- When is a function too small (noise) vs. just right (clarity)?
- Where should a **prototype** live in multi-file projects (headers vs. same file)?
- How to pick **parameter** order and **return** types for maximum readability?

## Related Concepts
- [[Black-box abstraction in functions]] – complements this note by framing functions as observable **interfaces** with hidden internals.
- [[Command-line arguments in C]] – shows **parameters** from the OS flowing into `main`.
- [[Exit status and echo $?]] – relates to **return values** at the process level.
- [[Array mutation with functions]] – shows how **pointers/arrays** behave when passed.
- [[Capitalizing constants in C]] – separates **constant** config from function logic.

## üìñ Definition  
**OPERATORS** *(noun, plural)* ‚Äî **symbols used to perform actions** in code, such as arithmetic, logic, comparison, or assignment.  
In this note, we focus on **arithmetic operators** and common **punctuation marks** used in C.

---

## ‚ûï Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Name | Action | Example | Result |
|--------|------|--------|---------|--------|
| `+` | plus / addition | adds numbers | `x = 2 + 3;` | `x = 5` |
| `-` | minus / subtraction | subtracts right number from left | `x = 5 - 2;` | `x = 3` |
| `*` | asterisk / multiplication | multiplies numbers | `x = 3 * 4;` | `x = 12` |
| `/` | slash / division | divides left number by right | `x = 10 / 2;` | `x = 5` |
| `%` | percent / modulus | gives the remainder | `x = 13 % 4;` | `x = 1` |

> These operators follow **PEMDAS** (order of operations): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

## üß± Common Syntax Symbols in C

| Symbol | Name | Use | Example |
|--------|------|-----|---------|
| `;` | semicolon | ends a statement | `printf("Hi");` |
| `:` | colon | rarely used directly in C (e.g., ternary operator in C++) | N/A |
| `()` | parentheses | grouping or function call | `printf("Hi")` |
| `{}` | braces / curly brackets | define code blocks | `int main() { ... }` |
| `[]` | brackets / square brackets | arrays | `int arr[5];` |
| `"` | double quotes | wrap strings | `"Hello"` |
| `'` | single quote | wrap characters | `'A'` |
| `,` | comma | separates items | `int x = 1, y = 2;` |
| `=` | equals / assignment | assigns a value | `x = 5;` |

### üîä Pronunciation Tips

| Symbol | Pronounced As |
|--------|----------------|
| `+` | "plus" |
| `-` | "minus" |
| `*` | "asterisk" or "star" |
| `/` | "slash" |
| `%` | "modulus" or "mod" |
| `;` | "semicolon" |
| `:` | "colon" |
| `{}` | "braces" or "curly brackets" |
| `()` | "parentheses" |
| `[]` | "square brackets" or "brackets" |
| `"` | "double quotes" |
| `'` | "single quote" |
| `=` | "equals" or "assignment" |
| `,` | "comma" |

## üìù Quick Note  
Operators are the building blocks of expressions in C.  
Understanding their **function**, **pronunciation**, and **punctuation role** helps you write **clear and correct code**.

When reading code aloud or asking for help, **using the correct operator names** improves communication with other developers.

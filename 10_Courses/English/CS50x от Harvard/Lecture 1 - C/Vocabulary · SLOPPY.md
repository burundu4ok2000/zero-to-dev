## 📝 Quick Note  
In CS50, Malan says:  
> “So for instance, suppose I got a little **sloppy**...”  

This means he intentionally wrote code in a **less-than-ideal or careless way** to show what *not* to do — often for teaching purposes.

Avoid sloppy code by:
- Naming variables clearly  
- Using indentation consistently  
- Handling edge cases thoughtfully

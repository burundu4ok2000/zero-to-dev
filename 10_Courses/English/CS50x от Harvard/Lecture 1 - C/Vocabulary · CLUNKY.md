## 📝 Quick Note  
In CS50 Shorts, the speaker says:  
> “Makes things a little bit shorter, not as **clunky**.”  

He’s referring to how declaring multiple variables on one line (like `int height, width;`) makes code cleaner and more readable, avoiding *clunky* repetition.

**Clunky code** = verbose, awkward, hard to maintain.  
Keep it lean and expressive!

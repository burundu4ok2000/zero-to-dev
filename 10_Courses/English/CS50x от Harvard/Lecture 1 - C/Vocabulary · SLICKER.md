## 📝 Quick Note  
In CS50 Shorts, the speaker says:  
> “It might make your code look a little **slicker**.”  

He means that **shorthand operators** (like `x *= 5;`) look **cleaner and more elegant** than the longer version (`x = x * 5;`).

**Slicker code** = visually neat, concise, and easy to follow — especially useful in professional or collaborative environments.

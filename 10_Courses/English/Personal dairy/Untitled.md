We are traveling 2200 km. That is a huge distance. I’ve wanted to watch a lecture, but I have not downloaded it on my computer. So I’m learning some built-in AI features of my computer now.

Now I’m lying in a second-floor bed. Learning how to use AI without the internet. In the morning, I had a little conversation with my colleagues. They were drinking alcohol, but I preferred to drink coffee with milk.

We're traveling 2,200 kilometers, which is quite a distance. I've been wanting to watch a lecture, but I haven't downloaded it on my computer yet. So, I'm currently exploring some built-in AI features on my computer.

A had a short, amusing chat with Roma and some other colleagues. They were quite tipsy! It was funny, but I felt a bit frustrated due to our long journey.

Feedback:

  

Certainly! Let's go through each sentence you wrote and compare them to the corrected version, highlighting the mistakes and explaining them.

  

1. **We are traveling 2,200 km. That is a huge distance. I’ve wanted to watch a lecture, but I have not downloaded it on my computer. So I’m learning some built-in AI features of my computer now.**

  

   - **Mistake:** "I’ve wanted to watch a lecture, but I have not downloaded it on my computer."

   - **Correction:** "I've been wanting to watch a lecture, but I haven't downloaded it on my computer yet."

   - **Explanation:** "I’ve wanted" is incorrect because "have wanted" is the correct past tense form. "Wanting" is an infinitive form and doesn't fit here. Use "have wanted" to indicate past desire.

  

2. **Now I’m lying in a second-floor bed. Learning how to use AI without the internet. In the morning, I had a little conversation with my colleagues. They were drinking alcohol, but I preferred to drink coffee with milk.**

  

   - **Mistake:** "Now I’m lying in a second-floor bed."

   - **Correction:** "Right now, I'm lying in a bed on the second floor."

   - **Explanation:** "Now" is incorrect because it's not needed here. Use "Right now" to indicate the present moment.

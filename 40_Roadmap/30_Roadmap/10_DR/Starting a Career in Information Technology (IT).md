## Starting a Career in Information Technology (IT)

The IT sector offers many paths, from building software to keeping systems secure and organising data for businesses. A systematic approach can help when deciding where to start and how to transition from a non‑IT background.

## What Does an IT Career Look Like?

- **Diverse specialties** – IT covers many domains. An 8‑step guide to starting an IT career stresses that beginners should first assess their interests, strengths and transferable skills, then select a domain such as cybersecurity, data analysis or software development [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Assessing%20Your%20Interests,and%20Skill%20Set). IT roles require both technical skills (e.g., coding, network configuration) and soft skills like communication and problem‑solving [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Assessing%20Your%20Interests,and%20Skill%20Set).
- **Multiple entry paths** – You can enter IT via self‑study, bootcamps, certifications or formal degrees. Education matters less than demonstrable skills; many employers value portfolios and experience over credentials [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20The%20Role%20of,Education%20in%20IT%20Careers). Certifications such as CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, CCNA and AWS Certified Solutions Architect provide recognised proof of ability [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=,before%20selecting%20a%20leadership%20program).
- **Hands‑on experience and networking** – Internships, part‑time jobs or volunteering offer practical experience and help build a portfolio. Entry‑level positions like IT support specialist, network administrator, junior data analyst or project manager build foundational skills [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=Step%206%3A%20Building%20a%20Strong,IT%20Resume%20through%20Practical%20Experience). Joining professional associations (IEEE, ACM, ISACA, CompTIA) and networking with peers and mentors can open job opportunities [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=Step%207%3A%20Expanding%20Horizons%20through,Networking%20and%20Professional%20Associations).
- **Lifelong learning** – The pace of technological change requires continuous skill‑upgrading. Successful IT professionals embrace constant learning and can communicate technical solutions to non‑technical stakeholders [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=Step%208%3A%20The%20Journey%20of,and%20Career%20Advancement%20in%20IT).

## Suggestions for Your Career Path

1. **Align Your Interests With an IT Specialty** – Since you enjoy sorting data and envision working in AI, **data engineering** or **machine‑learning engineering** are natural fits. Data engineering focuses on pipelines and infrastructure; this path builds a solid foundation for AI work. Machine‑learning engineering requires more mathematics and modelling but overlaps heavily with data engineering. Alternatively, **data analytics** is a good entry point with lower barriers; it can lead to engineering or science roles later.
2. **Plan Your Timeline (Aug 2025 – Jan 2026)** – You aim to secure a junior role abroad by early 2026. With five to six months, create milestones:
	| Month | Goal |
	| --- | --- |
	| **Aug 2025** | Finalise chosen IT pathway and review prerequisites. Enrol in targeted online courses (e.g., CS50, Datacamp/365 Data Science for data engineering) and set up a GitHub portfolio. Start an English blog (you mentioned “Zero to Dev”) to document your learning; writing in English will strengthen communication skills. |
	| **Sep – Oct 2025** | Acquire core technical skills. For data engineering: master SQL and Python; learn ETL tools (Apache Airflow, Apache Spark), cloud basics (AWS S3, EC2, Lambda), and data modelling. For data analytics: practise SQL queries and data visualisation. Complete at least one project (e.g., build a data pipeline that ingests open datasets and produces a dashboard). Add it to your portfolio and share progress on GitHub and LinkedIn. |

|  
| **Nov 2025** | Deepen knowledge and obtain at least one certification. Consider **AWS Certified Data Analytics – Specialty** or **Databricks Data Engineer Associate** to validate data engineering skills. Alternatively, earn **CompTIA A+** or **Network+** for general IT credibility [onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/how-to-start-it-career/#:~:text=,before%20selecting%20a%20leadership%20program). Continue building projects—maybe a real‑time streaming pipeline or a machine‑learning model using your curated data. |  
| **Dec 2025** | Start applying for internships or junior positions. Focus on countries with more accessible immigration (Germany, Netherlands, Canada). Use job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Relocate.me). Highlight your portfolio and certifications. Attend online hackathons or CS50 alumni events to network. |  
| **Jan 2026** | Prepare for interviews. Practise technical questions (SQL queries, data modelling, algorithms). Polish your LinkedIn profile and resume, tailoring them to each position. Secure reference letters from mentors or instructors. If offered a role, begin visa paperwork early; EU Blue Card or Canada’s Global Talent Stream may require job offers and proof of salary.

1. **Immigration Strategy** – Because relocating directly to the U.S. is challenging from Russia due to visa quotas, consider first moving to **Germany, Netherlands or Canada**, where skilled‑migrant visas are more accessible. After gaining 1–2 years of international experience, you can transfer internally to a U.S. office or apply for an H‑1B/E‑3 visa. Meanwhile, continue building your English fluency and network with U.S. professionals via CS50 communities, LinkedIn and Slack.
2. **Networking and Community Engagement** – Join the CS50 official communities. CS50 has official groups on Discord, Ed, Facebook, Gitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Slack, Stack Exchange and other platforms [cs50.harvard.edu](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/communities/#:~:text=So%20that%20students%20can%20connect,Exchange%2C%20TikTok%2C%20Twitter%2C%20and%20YouTube). Engage with classmates, ask questions and help others. Connect with data‑engineer Slack channels (e.g., **Locally** or **DataTalks.CLUB**) and join relevant Discord servers. Participating in open‑source projects or hackathons will expand your network.
3. **Develop Soft Skills and Cultural Awareness** – Improve your English proficiency (e.g., through conversation clubs or writing blog posts). Learn about the working culture in your target country; many European companies value work–life balance, while U.S. firms often emphasise results and longer hours. Understanding cultural differences will help you integrate.

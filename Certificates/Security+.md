> **One-liner:** **CompTIA Security+** is a vendor-neutral certification proving baseline **cybersecurity** skills: risk, identity, network/host security, cryptography, and incident response. 

---

## The Big Idea

Security+ validates that you can **assess risk**, **implement controls**, and **detect/respond** to common threats across networks, endpoints, and cloud services—using practical, vendor-agnostic methods.

---

## What It Covers (at a glance)

- **Threats & Vulnerabilities:** malware, social engineering, misconfigurations, attack surfaces
    
- **Architecture & Design:** secure network/host/cloud design, segmentation, zero trust, hardening
    
- **Identity & Access (IAM):** authentication, authorization, MFA, federation, least privilege
    
- **Security Operations:** monitoring, logging, SIEM basics, endpoint protection, patching
    
- **Cryptography Basics:** hashing, encryption, TLS, PKI, certificates, key management
    
- **Risk & Compliance:** policies, controls, assessments, governance, frameworks
    
- **Incident Response:** preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, post-mortem

## Who It’s For

- **Help Desk / IT Support** moving into security
    
- **SOC / Security Analyst (junior)**
    
- **Network/System Admins** adding a security baseline
    

---

## Exam Snapshot (high level)

- **Single exam** with **multiple-choice** and **performance-based** items
    
- **Vendor-neutral**, scenario-focused; **renewable** via continuing education
    

---

## Why It Matters

- Widely recognized **baseline** for entry-level security roles
    
- Solid bridge from A+/Network+ toward **Blue Team**, **GRC**, or **Cloud Sec** paths
    
- Emphasizes **hands-on controls** (not just theory) you’ll use on day one

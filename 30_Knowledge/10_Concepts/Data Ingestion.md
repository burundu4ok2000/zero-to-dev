  

> **One-liner:** **Data ingestion** is the reliable, repeatable **import** of data from sources into your storage/processing platform (lake/warehouse/queue) with guarantees about **freshness, completeness, and order**. [[Concepts]]

---

## **The Big Idea**

  

Get data **from where it is** (APIs, files, DBs, streams, sensors) **to where it can be used** (lake/warehouse/message bus) **without losing or duplicating** records—and do it on a schedule or continuously.

---

## **Where it fits**

```
[ Sources ] → Ingestion → [ Raw/Staging ] → Transform/Model → [ Analytics / ML ]
```

---

## **Common Modes (at a glance)**

- **Batch vs Streaming:** timed chunks vs event-by-event. [[Batch vs Streaming]]
    
- **Pull vs Push:** your job fetches vs source emits (webhooks/queues).
    
- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** ingest **only** inserts/updates/deletes. [[CDC (Change Data Capture)]]
    
- **File vs DB vs API vs Queue:** CSV/Parquet; SQL dumps; REST/GraphQL; Kafka/Kinesis.
    

---

## **Minimal checklist (what “good” looks like)**

- **Idempotent**: safe to rerun without duplicates.
    
- **Schema-aware**: detect drift, enforce types.
    
- **Incremental**: use watermarks/checkpoints; avoid full reloads.
    
- **Backpressure & retries**: handle rate limits and outages gracefully.
    
- **Observability**: log counts, lag, errors; alert on anomalies.
    
- **Security**: secrets, least-privilege, PII handling.

## **Tiny pseudo-example**

```
1) List new files in /landing/2025-08-03
2) Validate schema (required fields, types)
3) Write raw → lake (append-only, partition by date)
4) Record checkpoint (last file/offset)
```

---

## **Pitfalls to avoid**

- Silent drops/dupes (no idempotency).
    
- Schema drift ignored until transforms break.
    
- “SELECT *” over sources (slow/costly; project only what you need).
    
- No lineage: can’t answer “where did this row come from?”

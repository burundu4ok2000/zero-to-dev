## Registration on LinkedIn by Russian nationals (August 2025)

## Background – LinkedIn is blocked in Russia

- Russia’s government has blocked access to LinkedIn since 2016 for failing to comply with a data‑localization law.  
	A Moscow court ruled that LinkedIn had violated Russia’s requirement to store citizens’ personal data on servers within the country and the ban came into effect on **Nov 11 2016** [globalnetworkinitiative.org](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/linkedin-blocked-in-russia/#:~:text=November%2011%2C%202016).  
	The order prevents LinkedIn’s six million Russian users from accessing the platform [globalnetworkinitiative.org](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/linkedin-blocked-in-russia/#:~:text=November%2011%2C%202016). Because of this ban, LinkedIn’s website and mobile apps are inaccessible from Russian IP addresses.  
	Russians in Russia typically access LinkedIn only by using a VPN or by physically being outside the country. Once outside Russia (for example, if you move to the EU), LinkedIn is accessible without circumvention.

## Identity verification on LinkedIn

LinkedIn has introduced a **verification badge** to help users demonstrate authenticity. Identity verification is optional but may be requested if LinkedIn’s anti‑fraud systems flag your account or if you want the “verified” badge.

- LinkedIn’s **Persona** verification partner only accepts **NFC‑enabled passports or identity cards from specific countries.** LinkedIn states that identity verification by Persona is available only to members whose IDs come from the countries listed in its help article and that your LinkedIn profile location must be one of these countries screenshot.  
	The article lists permissible IDs for each country. For example, in Europe, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, etc. are supported screenshot screenshot. **Russia is not listed**, meaning **Russian passports are currently not supported** for Persona identity verification.  
	The same article notes that you must provide Persona with a photo of a valid NFC‑enabled government ID and scan the NFC chip screenshot.
- The lack of Russian support explains why Russian passports fail the Persona check. This is confirmed by the fact that the European section of LinkedIn’s list includes Belarus, Ukraine, the Netherlands, etc. but no entry for Russia screenshot screenshot.
- **CLEAR** is LinkedIn’s U.S.‑based verification partner. It is only available to users who have a U.S. Social Security Number or a U.S. driver’s license, so most Russian citizens cannot use this method.
- **Identity verification is not required to create a basic LinkedIn account.** You can sign up using an email address and phone number without uploading an ID. However, if LinkedIn restricts your account (for example, if your activity looks suspicious or if you use automation), it may request identity documents. Russian passports cannot currently be used for Persona verification, so you would need to verify via another supported document or by contacting LinkedIn support for manual review.

## Practical approaches for Russian nationals

1. **Register outside Russia or use a VPN.** Because LinkedIn is blocked in Russia, you must either be outside the country or use a VPN to access the site. If you live in the Netherlands (as the user does), you can sign up normally. If you are in Russia, a VPN that provides an IP address in an unblocked country is necessary.
2. **Create your account without identity verification.** During account creation, LinkedIn asks for your name, email and phone number. The identity verification badge is optional. If you skip it, your account will lack the verification mark but will still function. You can still apply for jobs and connect with other professionals.
3. **If LinkedIn requests identity verification:**
	- Use a supported document. The Persona list includes IDs from many countries but **excludes Russia** screenshot. If you have dual citizenship or a residence permit in a supported country (for example, an NFC‑enabled EU residence card, Netherlands ID or Russian‑issued Belarus e‑passport), you can verify using that document screenshot.
	- **Use a residence permit**. The list of supported documents for the Netherlands includes NFC‑enabled passports, identity cards and residence permits [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1631613#:~:text=Netherlands%20NFC,Passport%29%2C%20Identity%20card%2C%20National%20IDs). Since the user lives in the Netherlands, obtaining a residence permit or national ID would allow identity verification.
	- **Contact LinkedIn support.** If you do not have a supported ID and your account is restricted, open a support ticket explaining that your nationality is not supported by Persona. Some community reports indicate that LinkedIn may manually restore access when identity verification is impossible. This approach can be time‑consuming and is not guaranteed.
4. **Avoid risky work‑arounds.** Creating a LinkedIn account using someone else’s passport or falsifying your identity violates LinkedIn’s terms of service and could result in permanent account suspension. Similarly, using paid “phone‑number bypass” services may trigger fraud detection. Since Russian passports are not supported by Persona, using an Apple ID from another region does not solve the problem because verification is linked to your government ID rather than your Apple account.

## Summary

- LinkedIn is inaccessible in Russia due to a data‑localization ban [globalnetworkinitiative.org](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/linkedin-blocked-in-russia/#:~:text=November%2011%2C%202016), so Russians must use a VPN or register abroad.
- LinkedIn’s **Persona** identity‑verification program requires an NFC‑enabled passport or ID from a supported country. **Russia is not on the list** of supported countries screenshot; therefore a Russian passport will not be accepted.
- Identity verification is optional for account creation. Russian nationals living abroad can sign up using an email and phone number. If verification is later requested, you can use a residence permit or second citizenship from a supported country screenshot.
- Avoid fraudulent work‑arounds—using another person’s ID or fake documents violates LinkedIn’s terms. Instead, consider obtaining a local ID/residence permit in your country of residence or contact LinkedIn support for manual review if you cannot provide a supported document.

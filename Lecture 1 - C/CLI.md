## 🧠 CLI Explained

In Lecture 1, Professor David Malan introduces the **CLI**, or **Command-Line Interface**, as the alternative to GUI for interacting with a computer.

A **CLI** allows users to type commands directly, providing precise control over the system and programs. It’s favored by developers for speed, flexibility, and scriptability.

## 🖥️ CLI vs GUI

| Feature       | CLI (Command Line Interface) | GUI (Graphical User Interface) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ease of Use   | Steeper learning curve         | Very beginner-friendly        |
| Interaction   | Typed commands                 | Clicks, drag-and-drop         |
| Speed         | Faster for repetitive tasks    | Slower                        |
| Used in       | Terminals, servers, automation | Apps, browsers, file managers |

Professor Malan emphasizes that **the keyboard is more efficient than the mouse** for many programming tasks — like compiling code (`make hello`), running programs, and using tools like Git — especially when working in a terminal.

## ⚙️ Why It Matters in CS50

- CS50 uses Visual Studio Code with a built-in terminal.
- You’ll compile C programs (like `make hello`) using the CLI.
- Becoming comfortable with CLI is essential for real-world development.

> _“It’s much more efficient ultimately to use your keyboard more.”_

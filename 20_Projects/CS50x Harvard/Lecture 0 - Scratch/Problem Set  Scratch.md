### **✅ Summary**

  

I completed the first CS50x assignment using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a visual programming platform.

My game is titled **“Shark-VS-Pufferfish”**, and features:

- 🦈 A shark trying to catch a pufferfish
    
- 🐡 A defensive pufferfish that retaliates, but also can hurt Shark and win the game
    
- 🪼 A jellyfish that interacts with pufferfish sprite, makes it eatable for shark for 2 seconds
    
- 🎮 Sound effects - msde by me, game logic, and end condition detection

- Creating custom **game logic** using broadcasts and variables
    
- Managing multiple sprites and costumes
    
- Adding **interactions**, randomness, and visual effects

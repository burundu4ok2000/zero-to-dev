## The Big Idea

CompTIA certs are designed to prove **hands-on ability**, not just theory. They map well to real entry-level and mid-level roles and are widely recognized by employers across countries.

## Pick a Path (quick guidance)

- **IT Support → SysAdmin:** A+ → Network+ → Linux+/Server+ → Cloud+.
    
- **Cybersecurity (Blue Team):** A+ (optional) → Network+ → Security+ → CySA+ → CASP+.
    
- **Security (Offensive):** Network+ → Security+ → PenTest+.
    
- **Data/Analytics/DE:** Network+ (foundations) → Data+ → DataSys+ → Cloud+ → add Security+ for governance.

## Country Angle (practical)

- **United States:** very common in job listings (help desk, MSPs, gov-adjacent). Testing centers are plentiful; renewals valued by employers.
    
- **Europe (incl. Netherlands/Germany/UK/Ireland/Nordics):** recognized by multinationals; useful for early-career roles, often alongside a degree or portfolio. English-friendly exam options are standard.
    
- **Central/Eastern Europe (incl. Russia/CIS):** recognition varies by employer, but CompTIA still signals baseline competence; remote study communities and practice exams help bridge gaps.
    
- **Remote reality:** many roles are global-first; CompTIA provides a portable skills signal when relocating.

## Your First 30 Days (actionable)

1. **Choose one target role** (e.g., Help Desk, SOC Analyst, Junior Data Engineer).
    
2. **Scan 10 job posts** and note the certs listed most often.
    
3. **Lock one exam** (e.g., A+, Network+, or Security+) and set a date 8–12 weeks out.
    
4. **Daily reps (45–60 min):** split between reading, labs/simulators, and review questions.
    
5. **Build one tiny artifact per week** (troubleshooting log, network diagram, SQL backup plan) to add to your portfolio.

## Résumé Lines You Can Earn Fast

- “Completed CompTIA Network+ study plan; built a home lab with VLANs and DHCP.”
    
- “Documented incident-response checklist aligned to Security+ objectives.”
    
- “Created a backup/restore runbook (DataSys+ scope) and tested recovery.”

## Quick Vocabulary

- **Vendor-neutral:** not tied to one company’s products.
    
- **CEUs/renewal:** keep certs active via continuing education.
    
- **Performance-based items:** scenario tasks beyond multiple choice.

## Bottom Line

CompTIA gives you a **portable, employer-friendly baseline**. Pick one cert aligned to your target job, ship weekly artifacts, and use the exam date as your forcing function. Consistency beats intensity.

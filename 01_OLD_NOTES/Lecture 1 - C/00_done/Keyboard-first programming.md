## **📖 Plain Concept**

  

**Keyboard-first programming** — the practice of using the keyboard instead of the mouse to interact with the terminal and development tools, increasing speed and control.

  

> _“It’s much more efficient, ultimately, to use your keyboard more.”_

> — David Malan, Lecture 1 (7:01)

## **🧠 Why the professor emphasized this**

- The **Terminal** is text-based: there’s nothing to click — you have to **type** commands like make hello.
    
- Using the keyboard:
    
    - is **faster** for developers;
        
    - works in any environment (especially when there’s no GUI — e.g. remote servers);
        
    - reflects real-world practice for software engineering.
        
    
- Even in VS Code, using the mouse just opens a terminal, but you still **need to type**:
    

```
make hello
```

-   
    
- Malan introduces this idea early to help students **build professional habits**.

## **🤓 Related Terms**

- **Terminal / Shell** — a text-based interface to the system (e.g. Bash, Zsh).
    
- **Build tools** — software that compiles your code (like make in C).
    
- **make** — automates the build process; converts source code into executable.

**Summary:**

Unicode is a modern standard that extends the limited ASCII system to support a vast number of characters and symbols from all writing systems, as well as emojis.

  

**Example Discussed:**

David Malan demonstrates how Unicode can represent emojis using binary encoding. He shows the binary pattern:

```
11110000 10010011 10011111 10000010
```

This sequence of bytes corresponds to the decimal number:

```
4036991106
```

Which, according to the Unicode standard, represents the emoji:

```
ðŸ˜‚ (Face with Tears of Joy)
```

**Why It Matters:**Â This illustrates how Unicode uses multiple bytes to encode a huge variety of characters and symbols beyond the English alphabet. Unlike ASCII, which was limited to 128 (or 256) characters, Unicode can handle over a million unique symbols.

## ðŸ¤– Why AI?

Professor David Malan introduced "artificial intelligence" as a key theme of recent years and mentioned that:

- Weâ€™ll **come back to it** later in the course.
- The next few weeks will be about **learning to write code** that leads up to it.

## ðŸ§± Whatâ€™s the plan?

> "We're going to spend the next few weeks building up to [AI] by writing code."

That means:

- **We wonâ€™t start with AI directly**, but
- **Learn foundational skills first** â€” like functions, loops, conditionals, pseudocode, algorithms.
- Eventually, weâ€™ll use this knowledge to **understand or build programs that use AI**.

## ðŸš€ Takeaway

CS50x helps build the foundation necessary to understand and code with modern tools like AI.

## 🚀 What Is Scratch?  
Scratch is a **visual, drag-and-drop language** created at the **MIT Media Lab (Lifelong Kindergarten Group)** in 2003–2007.  
Instead of typing code, learners snap colored **blocks** together (like digital LEGO®) to control sprites, play sounds, and build games or animations.

| Aspect | Scratch | Text-Based Languages (C, Python …) |
|--------|---------|------------------------------------|
| Syntax Errors | Impossible – blocks only snap where legal | Very common (missing `;`, `)` …) |
| Visual Feedback | Live stage & sprites | Console / window output |
| User Level | Ages 8 + (true beginners) | Teens – adults |
| Under the Hood | Generates byte-code for the browser / VM | Compiled (C) or interpreted (Python) |

> **CS50 tie-in:** Harvard’s **CS50x Week 0** uses Scratch so students practice **algorithms, loops & conditionals** *without* getting stuck on punctuation.

## 🔗 How It Connects  

* **[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]** – birthplace of Scratch; the project is still maintained by MIT’s Scratch Team.  
* **[[01_OLD_NOTES/Lecture 0 - Scratch/Harvard University (USA)]] / [[CS50x Harvard]]** – adopts Scratch in Week 0 to help newcomers “think algorithmically” before diving into C.  
* **[[University of Cambridge (UK)]]** and **[[01_OLD_NOTES/Lecture 0 - Scratch/Harvard University (USA)]]**– both MIT and Harvard sit just blocks apart in this city; Malan’s phrase “down the street at MIT” is literal.  
* **[[Vocabulary · STEM]]** – Scratch is often the *first* tool in K-12 STEM programs, lowering the barrier to computer-science exploration.

## 📝 Why Start with Blocks?

1. **Concept > Syntax** – focus on loops, events, variables, not braces and semicolons.  
2. **Immediate Rewards** – kids see a cat dance; adults see logic spring to life.  
3. **Transferable** – once the *ideas* click, switching to C or Python is simply a new “dialect.”

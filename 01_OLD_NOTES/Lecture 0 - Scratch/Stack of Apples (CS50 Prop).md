| **Tradition** | An apple for the teacher → a friendly “welcome” gift for students.                             |
| **Brand nod** | Apple (Macintosh) computers are everywhere in CS50.                                            |
| **Energy**    | Post-lecture snack before the *adjourn-for-cake* celebration in the [[Vocabulary · TRANSEPT]]. |

## 🎓 CS50 Connection  
- Students are invited to grab an apple on the way out.  
- Often referenced in problem-set videos as a counting or sorting example.  
- Shows up in press photos alongside the giant duck.
